## Changes From First Algorithm

The algorithm will not use timers, the threads will check in real time for the packets and decide them.
This change will increase algorithm's performance

## New Measurements

After implementation, the following measurements will be made:
* Time it takes to synchronize
* Minimum number of packets needed to synchronize
* Comparing Time and Minimum number of packets to NTP
